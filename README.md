# Customers 1st - Vue3 Exam Project


## Introduction
Welcome to our 3rd semester exam project! We are a group of multimedia design students studying at UCL University College, and for our exam project, we created a website for a company called Customers 1st. Our website showcases some of the services provided by Customers 1st and serves as a representation of how their system could be redesigned to better meet the needs of their customers.

In this readme, we'll provide an overview of our project, including who we are, what Customers 1st is all about, what technologies we used, and how to launch the project locally. We hope you enjoy exploring our project and seeing what we've learned and created over the course of this semester.
